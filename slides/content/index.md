- Can you even universal app bro?
- Unit test EVERY SINGLE state change
- Be careful passing anonymous functions
- Use Enzyme
- Memoize selectors to be sure you donâ€™t change more state than you realize
- Passing in state through props is an anti-pattern
- Don't over use route params with react router because you can rightly couple logic to your business logic
